# Blue-Square-Backend
Rails API for React Client

This was a project completed at the Flatiron School Full-Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp. 
This was the capstone project at the end of the program.
The objective was to create a full CRUD react application while using a rails backend, external APIs and redux for state.

This is the backend/API for this project. This is built using ruby on rails, and google cloud for storage.

Blue Square is a ski resort browser where users can login, filter and sort through resorts based on over 15 criteria, write reviews of resorts, and save them to their past tripcs or want to go. 

Blue Square is inspired by my love of skiing and community.
When I'm planning my next ski trip, I always want to know about which resorts are best suited for my ability and interests.
For the advanced skier, I wanted to include the ability to search for resorts by most black runs, or most powder in a season.
For someone new to skiing or boarding, I have included ways to check for easy runs and places well suited for beginners.
The name blue square comes from the full name intermediate runs.
No one says "blue square" the way people say "black diamond", so here is an homage to the intermediate runs!
