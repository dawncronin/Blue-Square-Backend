Pico Mountain	https://www.picomountain.com/	Pico Mountain Ski Area is a ski area located in Killington, Vermont, United States. Established in 1937, it was one of the first commercial ski resorts in the state.[1] The base of the resort is located on the northwest side of Pico Peak on U.S. Route 4 approximately 9 miles (14 kilometers) northeast of Rutland, Vermont, and 3 mi (5 km) north of Killington Peak.	The mountain contains 468 acres (189 hectares) of skiable land on 58[8] trails of varying difficulty, divided into several lift areas. The trails from atop the golden express cater mainly to families and other beginner and intermediate riders. The trails which run from the peak of the mountain are generally steeper and mainly black diamond trails used by experts. They are reached via the summit express, which loads at mid mountain. Another area of Pico is Outpost. This region relies primarily on natural snow and is served by the outpost double, Pico's oldest lift. This area has seen less use in recent years. A very challenging area known as "Little Pico", has some of the toughest terrain. Pico also contains a freestyle terrain park, Triple slope, which contains small and medium size features.	89	43.6632	-72.84354	05751	Northeast	Vermont	12/14/2019	04/08/2020	250	1967	3967	468	57	7	17	44	36	3	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	https://storage.googleapis.com/blue-square-pictures/pico.jpg
